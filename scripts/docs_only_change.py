"""Is this change confined to documentation? Decides whether CI may run its cheap lane.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A one-file edit to `website/scripts/sync-docs.mjs` (#363) ran
**95 checks** on the pull request and the same matrix again on main: three
operating systems of Go tests, every compose-backed conformance suite, dbt,
Terraform, the medallion pairs. None of them can observe a markdown file. The
cost is not only runner minutes — it is the interval between "docs fixed" and
"docs published", which is what makes a small correction feel expensive enough
to skip.

WHAT MAKES THIS SAFE, AND THE ONE CASE THAT IS NOT. The docs gates do not move:
`witnesses` (parity claims, sidebar, intra-doc links, conformance matrix) runs
on EVERY change, docs or code, because it reads both. What the docs lane skips
is only the code that cannot see a markdown file.

The exception is real and was found by looking rather than assumed:
`check_docs_links.py` fails when a link points at a page that does
not exist, and check_witnesses.py fails when a green row's witness is gone. So a docs
change CAN break a Go test — but only by REMOVING or RENAMING a page, never by
adding or editing one. That is why a delete or a rename anywhere in the change
disqualifies the cheap lane, whatever the paths say.

SAFE DIRECTION IS "RUN EVERYTHING". Every unknown answers `false`: an empty
diff, a range git cannot resolve, a force push whose `before` is the null sha,
a path outside the known set. A classifier that guesses "docs" when it does not
know converts a missing verdict into a green one, which is the failure this
repo keeps finding in its own gates (see docs/parity.md's witness discipline,
and check_witnesses.py on skips that no longer skip).

Usage:
    git diff --name-status BASE HEAD | docs_only_change.py
    docs_only_change.py --self-test

Writes `docs_only=true|false` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT when set, and always prints the
verdict with the reason for it. Exit status is 0 for a readable answer of
either kind; non-zero only when the SELF-TEST fails.
