"""Keep the documentation navigable: no broken links, no unreachable pages.

Two failures, neither of which the site build catches:

1. **A link to a page that is not there.** Measured: the Astro build exits 0 on
   a dangling intra-doc link and publishes a 404. Renumbering or renaming a
   chapter rewrites filenames and the links pointing at them drift silently.
2. **A page missing from the sidebar.** Starlight's sidebar here is an EXPLICIT
   list, so a doc left out still builds, still gets a URL, and still appears in
   search. It is simply unreachable by navigation. Nothing fails.

WHAT COUNTS AS PUBLISHED is decided by `DOC_RE` in
`website/scripts/sync-docs.mjs`, and this **reads that regex rather than
copying it**. A copy under a comment saying "keep in step with sync-docs" is a
defect already filed, with no owner and no failing test: change the published
set and the copy stays green while guarding the wrong thing.

Run with --strict in CI.
